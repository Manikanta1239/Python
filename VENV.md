# 🚀 How to Use Python Virtual Environments (venv)

Python virtual environments (`venv`) allow you to create isolated environments for your projects. This helps avoid dependency conflicts and ensures a clean workspace for each project.

---
## 🎯 Why Use a Virtual Environment?
✔️ Prevents dependency conflicts between projects  
✔️ Keeps your global Python installation clean  
✔️ Allows testing with different package versions  
✔️ Essential for deployment and collaboration  

---
## 🔧 Creating a Virtual Environment
To create a virtual environment, use the built-in `venv` module (Python 3.4+):

```bash
python -m venv <directory>
```

📌 A common name is `venv`:
```bash
python -m venv venv  (or)  python -m venv myvenv
```
This command creates a new directory containing an isolated Python environment with its own Python interpreter and `pip` for package management.

---
## 🚀 Activating the Virtual Environment
Activation depends on your OS:

🖥 **Windows (cmd.exe):**  
```bash
venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```

🛡 **Windows (PowerShell):**  
```bash
venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

🐧 **Linux & macOS:**  
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

💡 **Once activated, your terminal prompt will change to indicate that you're working within the virtual environment.**

### 🔍 Checking Virtual Environment Activation
To confirm that your virtual environment is active:
```bash
which python  # macOS/Linux
where python   # Windows
```
The output should point to the Python binary inside `venv` rather than the global system installation.

---
## ❌ Deactivating the Virtual Environment
To exit the virtual environment and return to the global Python environment, run:
```bash
deactivate
```
Your terminal prompt will revert to its normal state.

---
## 🗑️ Deleting a Virtual Environment
To remove a virtual environment completely:

🖥 **Windows:**
```bash
rmdir /s venv
```

🐧 **Linux & macOS:**
```bash
rm -rf venv
```

This permanently deletes the virtual environment folder and all its contents.

---
## 📦 Managing Dependencies
### 📌 Saving Installed Packages
To create a list of all installed dependencies:
```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```
This generates a `requirements.txt` file, which can be used to reinstall the exact same dependencies in another environment.

### 📌 Installing Packages from a File
To install dependencies from `requirements.txt`:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This ensures that all necessary packages are installed in your virtual environment.

### 📌 Upgrading `pip`
After activating the virtual environment, it is recommended to update `pip`:
```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
```

### ❌ Deleting `requirements.txt`
If you no longer need the `requirements.txt` file, you can delete it:
```bash
rm requirements.txt  # Linux & macOS
```
```bash
del requirements.txt  # Windows
```

### 📌 Uninstalling All Packages from `requirements.txt`
To remove all installed dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`:
```bash
pip uninstall -r requirements.txt -y
```
This removes all listed packages, ensuring a clean environment.

---
## 🏆 Best Practices
### 🔒 Ignoring `venv` in Git
To avoid committing the virtual environment folder to Git, add the following to `.gitignore`:
```
venv/
```

### 🖥 Using `venv` in VS Code
1. Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl + Shift + P` / `Cmd + Shift + P`)
2. Search for **"Python: Select Interpreter"**
3. Choose the Python executable inside `venv`
